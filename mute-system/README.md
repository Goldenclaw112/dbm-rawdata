The command is currently... unoptimised, though I do plan on fixing that in future updates. For the meantime, everything in there currently works and provides errors when used incorrectly.

**Currently known bugs:**
While I haven't personally tested this, most likely there will be some sort of error if the bot is unable to find a user by ID when they leave in the unmute event. I'll eventually fix this.
